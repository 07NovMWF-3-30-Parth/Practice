        innertext
                => This property of javascript is used to get or set the text inside an html element and its descendants.
                => innnerText has a similar working phenomenon to innerHTML. Both manipulate the content of an HTML element but with different aspects.
                => innerText returns all text contained by an element and all its child elements.
        
        innerHTML
                => The element property innerHTML gets or sets the HTML or XML markup contained within the element.
                => This property can be used to write dynamic html on the html document.
                => Used mostly in the webpages to generate dynamic html such as registarion form, comment form, links etc.
                => innerHTML returns all text including html tags, that is contained by an element.

        textContent
                => it gets the content of all elements, including &lt;script&gt; and &lt;style&gt; elements.
                => innerText - shows - "human readable elements"
                => textContent - shows - every element in node.
        
        NodeList
                => A collection of nodes is called a NodeList
                    i.e. element nodes
                         attribute nodes
                         text nodes
                => A NodeList should not be confused with an array. Array methods will not work on a NodeList.
                => It can be created using queryselectorAll() method.
                => You can get the number of nodes in a list with a length property, which is really useful in loops.
                => It is similar to HTMLCollection, 
                    but javascript NodeList items can be only be accessed with their index number, 
                    while an HTMLCollection item can be accessed with a name, Id or an index number. 
        
        HTMLCollection
                => HTMLCollection interface represents a generic collection of elements and offers methods and properties for selecting from the list. 
                => An HTMLCollection in the HTML DOM is live; it is automatically updated when the underlying document is changed.
            imp.=> An HTMLCollection is a collection of document elements & its items can be accessed by their name, id or index number.
