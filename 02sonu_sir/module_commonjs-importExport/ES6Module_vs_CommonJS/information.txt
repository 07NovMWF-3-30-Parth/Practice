for import & export 

we have 2 ways
1) Commonjs - it is old way to import & export....it has many new developments.-mostly used
2) module(ES6) - it is new way to import & export...it is develping right now.-less used

in REACT we only using "module"(ES6) way

when we using commonjs way for import & export

1st file script.js - for export function
2nd file index.js - for import and call function

script.js-
	first 2 function of sum and diff exported with module(new ES6) way

	last 2 function of sim and mul exported with commonjs(old) way

same way
in index.js -
	"require ('file path)" used for commonjs way
	and
	" import {function} from 'file path' " with this we can use import and export in module(ES6)
