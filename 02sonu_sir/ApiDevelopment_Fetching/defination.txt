(1) Callback function
	callback function is a function which is passed into another function as an argument, which is in executed in outer function to complete some kind of routine action.

(2) Promise
	promise is an object, which is representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous 
	operation.
	Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks.
	there are 3 promise states : (1) pending, (2) rejected & (3) fullfilled.

(3) Callback hell(callback pyramid of doom)
	when there are two more asynchronous function executed back to back, where one function starts when other function succeeds.
	or we can say the phenomenon which happens when we nest multiple callbacks within a function is called "callback hell" or "callback pyramid of doom".

(4) thenable
	JavaScript thenable is an object that holds or implements the then() method and can have two callbacks, one for when the Promise is fulfilled, and one for when the Promise is rejected.
